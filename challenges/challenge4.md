# Challenge 4. Dancing by Xyber

Hybrid cryptographic communications are needed in real-world applications.
This challenge requires you to study how a server responds to different key exchanges. The right configuration will lead to the solution of the challenge.

## What I need to do. Getting started

- You need to send queries to this server 35.196.160.7:4433
- A example of client is provided (client.py)
- The client uses a pure-Python TLS library implemented in tlslite.
- tlslite/keyexchange.py has the key exchange stuff.

## Challenge objective

Find the appropriate algorithm configuration that results in a correct response from the server. This will return a flag to be sent to __ctf-rwpqc2024@sandboxaq.com__ with the subject "Challenge4".
